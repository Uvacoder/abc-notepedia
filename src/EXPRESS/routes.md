# Express route handlers

## Use

`use` always executes -â€º for middleware

```js
app.use('/users', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send('users');
});
```

`app.use` docs: 

https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.use

------

In Express, routes takes the following structure: `app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)`.

METHOD is an http method in lowercase. PATH is a relative path on the server (it can be a string, or even a regular expression). HANDLER is a function that Express calls when the route is matched. Handlers take the form `function(req, res) {...}`, where req is the request object, and res is the response object.

```js
function(req, res) {
  res.send('Response String');
}
```

will serve the string 'Response String'.

## [Creating route handlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction#creating_route_handlers)

This is a (callback) route handler function for HTTP `GET` requests to the site root (`'/'`):

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
});
```

- The callback function takes a request and a response object as arguments. 

- the method calls `send()` on the response to return the string "Hello World!". This ends the function

- There are a [number of other response methods](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#response-methods) for ending the request/response cycle, eg., you could call `res.json()` to send a JSON response or `res.sendFile()` to send a file.

## Other HTTP verbs

`app.get` is the same as `app.use` but only reacts to `get` requests



`checkout()`, `copy()`, **`delete()`**, **`get()`**, `head()`, `lock()`, `merge()`, `mkactivity()`, `mkcol()`, `move()`, `m-search()`, `notify()`, `options()`, `patch()`, **`post()`**, `purge()`, **`put()`**, `report()`, `search()`, `subscribe()`, `trace()`, `unlock()`, `unsubscribe()`.

special routing method: `app.all()`, which will be called in response to any HTTP method. Similar to `app.use()`

------

## 404-page / catch-all route

you can chain methods, but `send` has to be the last one

```
res.setHeader(...).send(...)
```

as the very last middleware:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.status(404).send('<h1>404 Page not found!</h1>');
});
```
