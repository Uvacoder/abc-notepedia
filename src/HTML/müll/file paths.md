# HTML File-Paths

| Path                              |                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<img src="picture.jpg">`         | The "picture.jpg" file is located in the same folder as the current page |
| `<img src="images/picture.jpg">`  | The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder in the current folder |
| `<img src="/images/picture.jpg">` | The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder at the root of the current web |
| `<img src="../picture.jpg">`      | The "picture.jpg" file is located in the folder one level up from the current folder |
| `./resources/css/index.css`       |                                                              |
| `./`                              | same folder                                                  |

It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).
